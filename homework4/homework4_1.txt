I believe “deep” neural networks are here to stay. They seem more flexible and usable than expert systems and single-
layer perceptrons.

Expert systems were too brittle. After 2000 rules they started to find contradictions between rules. This was not
sufficient to effectively model real-life situations. They also were very difficult to construct, as humans would have
 to come up with every rule. Neural networks, on the other hand, do not require the same kind of mental gymnastics to
 come up with rules and are not as brittle. These networks come up with their own indicators rather than requiring
 humans to find them.

Perceptrons, likewise, were not enough. A single layer of perceptrons using a linear activation function could not
 model non-linear systems. Deep neural networks are able to use non-linear activation functions to model these
 situations. For this reason I believe neural networks will be around for a long time, if not indefinitely.
