Base Problem:
Y: 6
N: 6

Hungry?
Y Stay:
    Y: 5
    N: 2
N Stay:
    Y: 1
    N: 4

Entropy = 1
Remainder = [7/12 * - (5/7 * lg(5/7) + 2/7 * lg(2/7))] + [5/12 * - (1/5 * lg(1/5) + 4/5 * lg(4/5))] = 0.8043

Gain = Entropy - Remainder = 1 - 0.8043 = 0.1957

This means that Hungry? is not as good an indicator as Patrons? but a better indicator than Type?.
