1. We want the machine learned model to be able to learn the difference between Christian songs and non-Christian songs
 based on title and author.

2. We want to be able to filter non-Christian songs from our radio station.

3. a) The number of Christian songs properly categorized.

b) We will have succeeded if there are no registered complaints due to a song being Non-christian.

c) Our ML model will be a failure if too many false positives occur or it doesn't find any Christian songs.

4. a) 0, 1

b) "Non-Christian", "Christian"

5. a) We need the output of the ML model before the next song is played (real-time).

b) Output will be used by audio program to determine whether to play the song or not.

6. We would use the fact whether key words like God, Faith, Jesus are in the title.

7. a) Binary classification: either Christian or Non-Christian

b) We already have a binary classification problem.

8. Input 1: Title
    Input 2: Artist
    Input 3: YouTube description
    Output: Christian/Non-Christian

9. Music Database containing genre category. From this we can get title, artist and genre, then we can poll YouTube's
 API for the song's description.

10. Artists and Song Titles are easy to obtain, they would provide a reasonable outcome.
