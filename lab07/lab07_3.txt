a)
Task1:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
)

Task2:
plt.scatter(calibration_data.predictions, calibration_data.targets)

There are some oddities.

california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].hist()

Some places have many rooms per person. I could imagine there are a few mansions in the California area.

Task3:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda val: min(val, 10))

b)
Synthetic features can be used to create a better feature for learning. Perhaps rooms and population do not tell the
whole story by themselves, but rooms per person might give a better understanding of the data.

c)
Outliers are points of data that extend far beyond the scope of the vast majority of the other data. Sometimes we clip
 them out so they do not give our learning a difficult time.
