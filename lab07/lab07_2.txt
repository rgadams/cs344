a) Categorical data represents characteristics that usually aren't naturally initially represented by numbers, like
gender and state of residency. They can be converted to numeric representations that are usually whole numbers.
Numerical data however, is usually naturally a number, like height and weight.

b)
Task 1:
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.0001,
    steps=100,
    batch_size=5
)

Task 2:
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00015,
    steps=200,
    batch_size=10,
    input_feature="population"
)

c) The hyperparameters are things like learning_rate, steps, and batch_size. There are some rules of thumb to try: if it
 is descending too slowly, increase the learning_rate, if it is bouncing up and down, the learning_rate is too high. If
  it seems like it still could go down, increase the steps. Batch sizes that are too small can also cause instability.
