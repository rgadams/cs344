a)
Exercise 1:
cities['San and big area'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & (cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: val.find('San')) + 1)
Exercies 2:
cities = cities.reindex([1, 3, 100])
cities['City name'][100]
This returns Nan. I think this is allowed because merging dataframes together might be easier this way.

b)
Pandas makes manipulating numpy arrays easy when the arrays have entries that correspond to other numpy arrays.

c)
If you want to sort or group the data by a particular column value, reordering the dataframe would be useful.
