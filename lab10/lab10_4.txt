a) Task 1:
If you have a linear function, there is not really any need to use a Deep Neural Network model for non-linear
 possibilities. Neural networks take much longer to train than Linear Classifiers, so if time is an issue then Linear
 Classifiers may be good enough.

b) Task 2:
The Neural Network model does worse on the training set but does about the same if not slightly better on the testset.

c) Task 3:
The embeddings do not seem to do any better than the non-embeddings. The accuracy of the non-embeddings was 0.8 and the
accuracy of the embeddings was 0.78.

d) Task 4-5:
Worst and awful have similar embeddings, this makes sense since they are both negative adjectives. They are used in
similar ways in sentences.

e) Task 6:
With a learning rate of 0.1, a clipping norm of 10, and hidden_units=[20,15], I was able to get an accuracy of 0.83
