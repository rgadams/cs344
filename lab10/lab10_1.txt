a) I would rather use Keras than Tensorflow. Keras allows us to specify layers much more easily without a lot of syntax.
It seems much more intuitive than the Tensorflow counterpart.

b)

Task 1:
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=20,
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

This got me a RMSE of 109.24

The RMSE on the testing data was 106.30
