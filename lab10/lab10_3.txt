a) The confusion matrix shows us how likely it is to label an image wrongly. For example, it has the most trouble
classifying 5s and 9s. It often classifies 5s as 3s and 9s as 4s.

b) The TensorFlow network is not a convolutional neural network like we used in class. It is just uses Tensorflow's
DNNClassifier which just makes dense layers. It also uses a different optimizer than the one we used in class.

c) The visualizations between 10 steps and 1000 steps is quite drastic. While it is difficult to discern exact features
on either, there is a distinct jaggedness on the 10 step version whereas the 1000 step version has more gradient-looking
 things.
