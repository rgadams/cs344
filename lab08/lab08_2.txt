2.

a) FTRL varies the learning rate differently for different coefficients which can benefit features that are rarely non-zero.
This seems very useful for binned features.

b) Bucketing/Binning allows the data to be separated into more digestible chunks for the neural network. Each new bucket
 contains a smaller amount of data but more meaningful data. I can imagine that it would be better to encode one-hot
  bucketized features rather than a single feature that has 0, 1, 2, ...

c)

Task 1:
  bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["latitude"], 10))
  bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["housing_median_age"], 5))
  bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["median_income"], 7))
  bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 5))

RMSE (on training data):
  period 00 : 169.76
  period 01 : 143.36
  period 02 : 126.86
  period 03 : 115.80
  period 04 : 107.93
  period 05 : 102.12
  period 06 : 97.73
  period 07 : 94.21
  period 08 : 91.34
  period 09 : 89.00

I was a bit skeptical about how bucketing could help, but seeing these results has convinced me that bucketing can be
useful. I guess if I think about it more, binning features allows us to separate different categories easier than a
single feature would allow.

Task 2:

I used latitude x longitude for my feature cross. It was simple but made sense to go simple with that. Latitude and
Longitude are not related in a correlation fashion, but are the two together give a better indication of location than
 both separately.

long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(["latitude", "longitude"], 1000)

RMSE (on training data):
  period 00 : 162.17
  period 01 : 133.65
  period 02 : 116.66
  period 03 : 105.53
  period 04 : 97.72
  period 05 : 92.03
  period 06 : 87.61
  period 07 : 84.07
  period 08 : 81.32
  period 09 : 79.05
