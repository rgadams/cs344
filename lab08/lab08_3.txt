a) Seaborn looks like it is very flexible and easy to use to generate lots of plots quickly, whereas MatPlotLib looks
more customizable and complex.

b) There are 397 entries in the dataset. More data could be useful, but it seems like we could enough information from
a dataset of this size for at least a reasonable guess.

c) Since the data has many different scales associated with different features, it can be helpful to scale each variable
 down so each feature is on the same scale. This allows the weights on the neural network to work more efficiently.

d) This is not a linear regression model, but rather a non-linear regression model. The neural network uses non-linear
activation functions at each hidden layer.

e) I'm not sure that smaller datasets "prefer" smaller networks, but perhaps smaller datasets would have problems with
overfitting a large neural network. In order to properly train with a small network it may need more epochs to train a
large neural network, resulting in possible overfitting.
